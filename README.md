# 3D-GameEngine
This is a first person game engine that will be used as a base for some of the projects I have in mind.
So far this project is at version alpha: [1.1].

The next update is to be expexted at 10th October.
The next version will feature an animated projectile, attack animations, entity behaviour (maybe including deaths).

Dependancies:
  RAYLIB which can be installed following the tutorials found at: https://www.raylib.com/index.html

It is currently in Alpha but is being updated somewhat frequently.
It uses RAYLIB to handle drawing to the screen.
  RAYLIB can be found at:https://www.raylib.com/
  RAYLIB LICENSE: https://www.raylib.com/license.html
  THIS PROJECT USES BUT DOES NOT MODIFY THE RAYLIB LIBRARY. ALL CREDIT GOES TO: https://github.com/raysan5.
