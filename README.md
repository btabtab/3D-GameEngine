# 3D-GameEngine
Version alpha [1.2]:
the "Primitive Beginnings update".
This update features:
	animated projectiles,
	animated walls,
	some primitive enitity behaviour (so far only side to side movement exisits),
	and (most importantly) player attack animations.

The next update is to be expected at 13th October.
it will feature:
	Per-Room events (so when you step into a room something may happen, such as an enemy spawning),
	Terrain for different rooms (such as some bushes and rocks)
	
The new "gameplay features" (i use that term very loosley as of now), will be acheived through, per-room nodes. This will be a set of distinct points that will be generated within a room that will be used for navigating entities, generating terrain and generating objects.
